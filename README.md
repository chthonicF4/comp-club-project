# comp club project
this is a thing i made as a challenge 

# files :
server.py is the server (i know right?!) it just mangages connectins between clients so that it all works
client.py is what you actualy use , but you cant use it without having a server to connect to. 

# how to :
step 1. run the server and coppy the code 
step 2. use this code to connect to the server from a client program , then you are connected and that.

# trivia :
when you run the server it outputs a log file in the logs folder which will be made if it is deleted so dont worry about deleting it if there are a lot of useless logs

there is actualy a chat feature in the code i just havent made a way for it to be used yet.
