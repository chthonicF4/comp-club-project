server.py is the server (i know right?!) it just mangages connectins between clients so that it all works
client.py is what you actualy use , but you cant use it without having a server to connect to. 

step 1. run the server and coppy the code 
step 2. use this code to connect to the server from a client program , then you are connected and that.
